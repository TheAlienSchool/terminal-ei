## Evolution Journey

This project evolved through careful iteration:

1. **Terminal E.I.** – Initial echo-locative intelligence concept
2. **1000 Ways to Sit Integration** – Connection to physical sanctuary space
3. **Gamelatron Sonic Sanctuary** – Full thematic alignment with Sound Infused Air
4. **Single-File Consolidation** – Achieved PlayHTML.fun philosophy (66% size reduction)

Previous versions explored multi-file architecture before embracing the elegance of a single, self-contained HTML experience.
