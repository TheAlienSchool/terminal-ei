# Terminal E.I. :: Echolocative Intelligence International

A single-page HTML terminal for inner navigation.

## What this is

- A small, static site that guides a traveler through:
  - Boarding PING (arrival word)
  - Verb selection (SENSE, CATCH, NAME, MOVE, TUNE, OPEN, SHIFT)
  - In-Flight reflection
  - Landing PING (departure word)
  - Baggage sorting
  - Vinyl Lounge (shared resonance)

- No accounts
- No tracking
- No external JS frameworks

## How it works

- Data lives in `localStorage` only
- Export feature downloads a `.json` file of the traveler’s journey
- All interaction is optional, paced by the traveler

## Built in the spirit of PlayHTML.fun

- One HTML file
- Inline CSS
- Minimal JS
- View source, learn, remix
